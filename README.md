## Variables Widget

This repository now contains a single, self-contained interactive widget page that teaches 6th graders how to store and change a value in a variable. 

The demo includes simple explanatory text, an interactive input, buttons to set/add/reset a `score` variable, and a live code view that shows how the variable changes.
